Machine Learning Assisted Breaking of Scaling Relationships Analysis: In this work, machine learning is used to rapidly predict adsorption energies of key ORR intermediates (*O, *OH, *OOH) on graphene-supported subnanometer Pt clusters. Geometric, electronic, and elemental descriptors are engineered to capture the local coordination environment and fluxional behavior of active sites. Ensemble models such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest achieve MAE values of ~0.21–0.28 eV, enabling fast and accurate activity estimation. SHAP interpretability reveals geometry-driven scaling-relationship breakdown in the subnanometer regime. The ML-predicted energies are integrated into volcano plots and reaction network analysis to identify highly active ORR electrocatalysts under realistic coverage.
